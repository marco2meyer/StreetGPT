assistant: Hi, my name is Diotima. I am a street epistemologist that can help you examine your beliefs. What is your name?
user: Marco
assistant: Nice to meet you, Marco! I'm here to help facilitate a conversation to explore one of your beliefs. Can you please articulate a belief you're interested in examining? This could be anything you believe; like "monogamy is natural for humans", "artificial intelligence will replace most human jobs", or "euthanasia is morally wrong". What's a belief that you feel strongly about, and wouldn't mind spending some time discussing?
user: I actually think monogamy is not natural for humans.
assistant: Thank you for sharing, Marco. To make sure I understand your belief correctly: you believe that monogamy is not a natural inclination for humans but rather a societal construct or a personal choice, correct?

And before we delve deeper into this topic, on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you in this belief, with 1 being not very confident and 10 being completely confident?
